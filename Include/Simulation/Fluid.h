/* the 2D fluid class based on Navier-Stokes equations
 * for incompressible fluids
 *
 * There are 2 equations:
 * (1) divergence of verlocity = 0
 * What this means is that velocities in neighboring
 * areas of a fluid cannot be flowing towards each other
 * or away from each other. This is because if it is possible
 * then somewhere  matter would have to created
 * out of nothing or disappear into nothing.

 *      v
 * 
 * Essentially, the equation makes sure that mass is conserved
 * in the fluid. (CONSERVATION OF MASS)
 * 
 * (2) Acceleration of a fluid depends upon its internal forces
 * (pressure gradient (fluid flows from high to low pressure) & 
 * viscocity) and external forces (gravity, wind, walls etc.)

         *            vYCurr(i,j+1) - vYCurr(i,j-1))/2
         * 
         * (2) Compute a field of p values (scalar values)
         * div(i,j) = 4p(i,j) - (p(i-1,j) + p(i+1,j) + p(i,j-1) + p(i,j+1))
         * Rearranging,
         * p(i,j) = (p(i-1,j) + p(i+1,j) + p(i,j-1) + p(i,j+1) + div(i,j))/4
         * 
         * This is a system of simultaneous equations, and we use
         * Gauss-Seidel iterative solver to solve for p(i,j)
         * 
         * Now we need to find the gradient vector field of this scalar field,
         * which is
         * divP(i,j) = (p(i+1,j) - p(i-1,j))/2, (p(i,j+1) - p(i,j-1))/2
         * 
         * One of the identities of vactor calculus states that the
         * CURL OF SUCH A GRADIENT VECTOR FIELD = 0
         * The curl of the gradient is the integral of the gradient 
         * round an infinitesimal loop which is the difference 
         * in value between the beginning of the path and the 
         * end of the path. In a scalar field there can be no difference,
